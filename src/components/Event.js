                  In the 2021 August Pop Up, I was invited to speak about an issue through a creative medium. Writing a speech may have not been the most creative idea, however this experience matched none other. The community built, the <i>amazing</i> food, mainstream enthusiasm and more made this into more than just a night out.

              <p className="p-manifesto">
                  Today, I’d like to tell you the story of a boy. Coming into Grade 9, he was… how do I put this gently… he was high-pitched and confused. As he went into Grade 9, he tried his best to fit in but he surrounded himself with the wrong people in an attempt to be the exact same. He had spent his past 3 years trying to get high marks and join clubs, which deprived him of his middle school social experience. He wasn’t doing what he wanted to, and rather than standing out he tried to blend in. Now, if you haven’t guessed so far, the boy in the story was me. Today, I’m gonna talk about the one thing that I’ve spent the past two years focusing on: living life. Now I’m not talking about skydiving and skipping school everyday, but rather the importance of being aware and taking action. In my speech, I’ll discuss the art of postponing our work, finding your passion, time machines, the immense power of regret in our minds and then my story. <br/><br/>

So. The hard truth is that life is short. There’s no way to avoid that statement. Every second ticks down to an inevitable moment, so why are we dreaming? It may sound easy, but youth today are faced with unfair expectations in an unfair environment. People wait for you to fail and make it more and more difficult to spend our time doing things for yourself. Ok, so the obvious solution is to work hard until you become successful, right? Well, what are the metrics to be successful? What is required for you to be a celebrity? 10 Million followers? Maybe having a million dollars in the bank account? There is none, its all in our minds. We wait for our future selves to be successful, we don’t know what we’re working towards. So what does all this mean? It means our time is valuable, and it is important to do things now. Every single person in this room is going to do great things, and yet we wait for things to come to us. You only live once, find your passion, find what you want to do and well, take action now. <br/><br/>

As mentioned in the introduction, I promised to talk about time machines. And you’re right, it’s important that I elaborate. A time machine feels like it could be our saviour. Visit the past, change our wrongdoings, live a longer life. However, once again we are burdened with the reality that this is probably not going to happen. Well, if my future self walks in this room at this time, then maybe it would be a different story. *waits 5 seconds* Ok, so it looks like time machines aren’t happening. So rather than finding a million ways to fix the past, do what you can in the present. This may sound like obvious advice, but the majority of people including myself find it difficult to accept the past and move on. Life may be short, but you have a long way ahead of you. It’s important that you acknowledge what’s done. Don’t wait for your time machine. Worst case scenario, just sit back and laugh. <br/><br/>

So when it comes to power, there are many powerful forces. Some are physical, others are environmental, but one of the most powerful forces out there is regret. Our minds make up who we are, and can shift what we are going to do in the future. Regret hurts us, and continually gives us a painful mindset. Our mental health is what keeps us ready, it's what gets us up every morning and it's what makes up our presence. If we burden our mental strength with regret and living in the past, we are inevitably harming our body as a whole. Let's say you get to pick between two items at a restaurant, no matter what you pick you will regret not getting the other. That’s how the mind works. As teens, our minds are only developing further, and it is critical that during any difficult time to avoid jealousy, anger and regret. <br/><br/>

Now, I've been speaking a lot today. So I thought it would be appropriate to share more about my experience in this topic. For the past year or so, I’ve dedicated my actions to the mindset of living life. Essentially, eliminating boundaries that stop me from doing what I’ve always wanted to do. I wrote a book, I learned 5 different programming languages, started a company, I started a social media campaign for indigenous awareness by running 160km and most importantly, I made sure that I stuck with these decisions. These activities changed who I am today, and who I aspire to be. I’m gonna call upon someone… you! Yeah you. Is there anything you want to do? Write a book, start a podcast, learn something, climb mount everest?<br/><br/> 

Ok. Then What’s Stopping You? I want you to promise me that after today, you will pursue what you want to do. There’s no point in postponing this, why not do it now?<br/><br/>

Alright so to conclude, our minds are the most important thing for every individual.  One of my favourite songwriters said, “the point i'm trying to make is that the mind is a powerful place, so defeat can affect you in a powerful way”. As teens, and well as humans, we are unjustifiably burdened with regret and stress on a daily basis. My intentions here today were to share to you why you should live life to the fullest, in whatever context that means to you. Whether you want to go skydiving every day, or just learn a new skill, listen to yourself and do what's going to make you into a more powerful individual. So, do what you want to do as we are just younglings in the vast size of this universe. You can make an impact. You can follow your dreams. So tell me, what's your fate going to be?<br/><br/>

Thank you.

                  I would just like to thank the organizers, facilitators, sponsors and fellow speakers who made this night an exhilarating experience. This was one of my first proper events after the lockdown, and I'm so glad stay woke was the first. May there be many more.
