                  My Run For Hope was a unique initiative that I took on during this summer of creation and impact. In the recent <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8022971/graves-residential-school-penelakut-island/#:~:text=Comments%20closed.-,Over%20160%20graves%20found%20at%20former%20residential,B.C.%20island%2C%20First%20Nation%20says&text=A%20B.C.%20First%20Nation%20in,residential%20school%20within%20their%20territory.">tragic news</a> of graves found at several residential schools, I had taken it upon myself to start a new project. At a glance of an eye at my phone, I noticed a teacher hiking 215km for a similar reason, which inspired me to do something in the same light. Running 160km was no easy task, but it developed discipline, public awareness and physical wellbeing.

              <p className="p-manifesto">
                Writing was never my forte. My peers and parents doubted me, but most importantly, I doubted myself. I had planned a computational future to avoid this obstacle, but came to realize that writing could supercharge my love for expression. Last year, students were given an opportunity to improve themselves through the Personal Project and I decided to expand my literary knowledge by writing a novel. By no means was this an easy task, but 103 pages and months of extensive planning, writing and editing later, I formally introduced ‚ÄúBreaking Barriers''. The novel tells the story of an autistic boy and his adventures to become a lawyer, which brought attention from the community, publishers and peers. I promptly distributed 25+ copies and raised awareness on my social media campaign; it is now my intention to donate physical copies of the novel to local libraries and the Autism Society.

                To put it lightly, I have an unhealthy addiction to hackathons-blasting music until 2am, working to win big prizes and learning how tech can make physical impact has inspired myself and several of my peers. Hack Club, a community for youth programmers, has developed a tightly-knit group of student leaders who are passionate about change, and I am honoured to be working with them. I've placed in 3 hackathons, and have won several other awards that reflect on the hard work and effort our team puts towards our solutions.

                The International Internship Program (IIP) has put together a remote Public Health Internship. As interns, we will work with project managers and health care professionals in Bauchi, Nigeria to develop and implement public health campaigns that target major health concerns such as immunization, reproductive health, adolescent health, food and nutrition, child health, drugs, food hygiene and safety, control of Malaria, and HIV/ AIDS. I am incredibly excited to be working alongside a passionate group of 7 to help make direct impact on the other side of this world.
